What happens when we change the Rmd file and commit?

In Blog 5 you had the first exposure to Github Actions. 
We just checked frontmatter compliance (as we do for this round).
You see that we have added a second action - here, we are converting the Rmarkdown document to a markdown file by running `render_rmarkdown` on Github. This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.


Now start reading ...


Read the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.

Then do:

1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**

2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**

3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**

4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**

5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**

Yes! It's working :)

Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**

R package dependencies are easier to manage and reproducible environments are easier to create with the `renv` package. The use of renv means you will spend less time worrying about package version mismatches and more time developing or analyzing.

2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**
 
Before I pushed the changes to my blog4 repo, I did a few things to make sure everything was in order.

First, I hit up "renv::init()" to get my R environment all set up for this project.

Then I called "renv::dependencies" to make sure all my package dependencies were good to go.

After that, I hit up "renv::snapshot()" to save my project library in case I needed to roll back my updates.

Next, I added "check-yaml.yaml" to my workflow folder because the badge code shows the status of the workflow defined in my ".github/workflows" directory. I also added "schema.json" and "schema.yaml" to my ".github" folder and copied and pasted the ymal and json code from blog 5.

That's when I spotted a problem: the ymal in the read.rmd file for blog 4 was messed up. The dates weren't in quotation marks "", and the categories were spelled like "category." So, I fixed those issues and pushed everything up to my repo. Easy peasy!
I followed the same process for blog 6, and now both badges are showing "passing."
