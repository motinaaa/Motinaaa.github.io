## Hi There
My name is Motahareh Kashanian, Feel free to call me Motina!
I graduated from Amirkabir University of Technology in 2016 with a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering. During this time, I started developing my mathematical modeling and machine learning skills. One year later I started the M.Sc. program in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology which I completed in 2020. While completing this degree, I worked on a sourcing plan for a sustainable biomass portfolio using multi-stage stochastic programming, including land-use suitability analyses using geographic information systems in order to ensure the continuity of biomass supply in the Iranâ€™s bioethanol supply chain. I was able to publish my work in a peer-reviewed journal as the lead author.
A desire to integrate supply chain and artificial intelligence led me to pursue a doctoral degree in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at Iowa State University in 2021. As part of my academic journey, I have acquired several different skills, including supply-chain design and management, analytical and problem-solving skills, mathematical programming, simulations, and data mining techniques. In my role as a research assistant under the direction of Dr. Sarah Ryan, I worked on a project funded by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. DGE- 1828942andEFMA-2132200.As a part of my research, I designed a supply chain for a novel monomer, which has gained increasing interest due to its ability to replace adipic acid in Nylon 6,6 and produce polyamides with superior performance. Green electrochemistry is used to produce this monomer, a method which has shown promising results in the conversion of biomass into commodities. As a means of ensuring the successful commercialization of this product, I designeda proper supplychain that is both economically and environmentally beneficial.
In addition to starting my Ph.D. in the first semester, I also became an NSF-funded DataFEWSion graduate trainee at Iowa State University. This is an interdisciplinary graduate traineeship focused on research at the nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (FEWS). This program provides me with an opportunity to gain analytical skills such as data-driven decision modeling and an understanding of the complexity of the FEWS nexus, in addition to professional skills and communication abilities. I am nearing the end of the fourth semester of my PhD program and I plan on publishing two first-authored papers in peer-reviewed journals, as well as making significant contributions to two other peer-reviewed publications.
 The focus of my future research will be on the Food-Energy-Water Nexus, specifically the use of biomass for producing desired chemicals to promote the adoption of green electrochemistry in the chemical industry, in addition to facilitating the implementation of distributed electrochemical manufacturing processes by developing an optimized supply chain. I believe that this timely effort will lead to the decarbonization of the U.S. chemical industry, transform the power for chemical industries, and advance American chemical manufacturing leadership.
In addition, I intend to improve crop production, particularly for corn and soybeans, by optimizing genotypes, environments, and management practices by integrating weather information throughout the growing season and utilizing deep learning frameworks to predict yields. It is also imperative that my research be conducted in order to address the challenges posed by growing populations, decreasing cropland, and climate change, all of which are negatively affecting agriculture and making crop breeding more necessary than ever before.
A key aspect of my research will be to develop a problem-solving framework that can be applied to a wide range of Food-Energy-Water Nexus research topics, including supply chain management, crop yield prediction for sustainable agriculture, and energy management in electrical power systems. To make better predictions and decisions from data, I plan to combine optimization, simulation, statistics, and machine learning techniques. Having experience in biomass and agricultural residues, I can leverage renewable energy across the supply chain to reduce long-term costs, mitigate risks, increase revenue, and increase employee engagement. As technologies and regulations continue to evolve, I am confident that I can assist companies in developing strategies that take advantage of these benefits.
