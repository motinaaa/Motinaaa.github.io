# Education
Welcome to my personal website! I'm a researcher, engineer, and soon to be singer!

I graduated from Amirkabir University of Technology in 2016 with a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering. During this time, I started developing my mathematical modeling and machine learning skills. 

One year later I started the M.Sc. program in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology which I completed in 2020. While completing this degree, I worked on a sourcing plan for a sustainable biomass portfolio using multi-stage stochastic programming, including land-use suitability analyses using geographic information systems in order to ensure the continuity of biomass supply in the Iran’s bioethanol supply chain. I was able to publish my work in a peer-reviewed journal as the lead author.

A desire to integrate supply chain and artificial intelligence led me to pursue a doctoral degree in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at Iowa State University in 2021. As part of my academic journey, I have acquired several different skills, including supply-chain design and management, analytical and problem-solving skills, mathematical programming, simulations, and data mining techniques. 

# Research Interests
A key aspect of my research will be to develop a problem-solving framework that can be applied to a wide range of Food-Energy-Water Nexus research topics, including supply chain management, crop yield prediction for sustainable agriculture, and energy management in electrical power systems. To make better predictions and decisions from data, I plan to combine optimization, simulation, statistics, and machine learning techniques. 

You can also see more about my background on my [**CV**](CV.pdf).


# Personal intersts

I have a few passions in life that I absolutely love. Singing is at the top of my list - it's such a freeing experience. When I'm not singing, I'm usually lost in a good book or catching up on my favorite movies and TV shows. And when it comes to fashion, I love experimenting with different colors and expressing myself through my outfits. 

Thanks for visiting my site, and I am grateful for any feedback you may have!

Cheers,

Motina (موتینا)
